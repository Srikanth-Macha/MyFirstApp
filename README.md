# MyFirstApp
This is a learning a project that I have built while learning user input (clicks) in android dev

Its Basically a Dice App that shows a random number from 1 to 6 when roll button is clicked by the user

This project is a practice for activity to run when a user interacts (clicks) any button on the screen

Going to add nice animations to the numbers view in future!!

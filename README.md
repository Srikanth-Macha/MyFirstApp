# MyFirstApp
This is a learning a project that I have built while learning user input (clicks) in android dev

Its Basically a Dice App that shows a random number from 1 to 6 when roll button is clicked by the user

This project is practice for activities to run when a user interacts (clicks) with any button on the screen and to update the value that is already shown on the screen
